1. Learning js Objects
      const person = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 50, eyeColor: "blue" };
write a function that gets as parameter the object
this function should convert the object into the string of the following structure:
object keys: list of keys (or variables)
key1name: value
...
keyNname: value

2. write a function that gets the simple object as string
key1name: value
...
keyNname: value
that returns the object
example:
input:
x: 10
y: 12
output: {x:10, y:12}


3. Find all duplicates in the array and output the array of ojects with numbers and their counts.
[{number: xx, count: yy}, ....]
example:
input: [1,2,1,2,3,2]
output: [{number: 1, count: 2}, {number: 2, count: 3}, {number: 3, count: 1}];

4. Write a small web-app that allows to the user:
to factorize the input number to prime factors
to find a least common multiple of several numbers that user enters,
to find greatest common divisor of several numbers that user enters.

5. Suppose you have an object
var node = {id: N, next: node}
Every node references the next node;
example
var node3 = {id: 2, next: null} // the last one
var node2 = {id: 21, next: node3} // reffers to the next node3
var node1 = {id: 1, next: node2}  // reffers to the next node2

Prepare the function that finds the last node, having the first one as parameter
It should have the following signature:
// it should return the last node
function getLastNode(firstNode)
Note: the function should not fail in case of an infinite loop, in this case it should return the node, 
that referse to the previously met node
Example of an infinite loop:
node1 -> node2 -> node3 -> node2
