- todo: from pause to continue (follow recom. should be Resume progress)
      in this case on onDlgFollowResume() should inititate the prevous progress.

- todo: style buttons: progress, ...
- todo: from follow recommandation in pause to continue?
+ todo: add progress button? by clicking it stop current run, show recommendation
  (Learing Step Is Finished! - > in case if not finished it should be:
  Learing Step Is Paused!)

- todo: history, check if works for all
- todo: Quizer, concept and implementation
    idea: run quiz from 30 questions, give recommendation
          estimate the skill for each level: 100%, ... 1%
- todo: multiply 5x*5x=2500+100x+x*x= (25+x)*100+x*x
51*51 = (25+1)*100+1 = 2601
59**2 = 3400+81=3481
53**2 = 2809




+ td: more button in done dialog, show the grid with longest and false with
  details, op, res, time, true/false, score
  remark: one could just open history, but extend the history with:
    show wrong & longer than: 5 | sec (5 or 6 or ... should be defined)
    show wrong answers
    show correct answers
+ todo: restore help
    
+ show progress or learning step.
  + if selfTester just step: nn
  + if tutor: progress: nn/NN
  + if progress is 100% dialog dlgFinishedTeachingId
          in it the recommandation should be taken from history

+bug in progress, it starts from 2
+ for more generality make next2Numbers return an object n1, n2, opr;

todo: clear history
todo: after finishing tutoring, dialog:
+ do you like to repeat all or the most difficult cases?
  this scenario: first - errors, second - the longest 10, that took more than 5 sec.
+ do you like to test your skills in a random way?
   ---> postponed: this should be done by quizer? ask the most difficult 20 and get estimate.

+todo: tricks for mult *11 -> a*11=aa, ab*11=a{a+b}b,19*11=209

-todo: recommended triks to use: tutor: 
nn*25 nn/4 r:0 00 r:1 25, r:2 50, r:3 75
96*25= 2400 97*25 = 2425 98*25=2450, 99*25=2475

-todo: recommended tricks
1x * 1y = (1x+y)*10 + x*y
 1x*1x = (1x +x)*10 + x*x 
 9x*9x = [y=10-x] -> (9x-y)*100 + y*y
 Example: 14*14 = (14+4)*10 +16 = 180+16=196
 19*19 = 280+81=361
 17*17 = (17+7=24)*10+49=289
 13*13 = 160+9=169
 97*97 = (100*100-2*3*100+9) = 100*100 - 2*300 + 9 = 
 ->(97-3)*100+9 = 9400 + 9 = 9409
92*92 -> (92-8)*100 + 8*8 = 8464

+todo: in onClick update the empty history record with answer and score
+Test the above
+todo: make right score calculation for all servers

todo: finish and debug history records.
+ by preparing question - create and add it, after the answer, fill the answer


todo: save history
  for selfTester
  for tutor
  

+: make selfTester working
      +clear old question, make a new one.
      +make it random, even if by tutor was sequential
      +refresh score - should be 0.

todo:      ??clear history
      
+: remove state from index.js


refactoring:
+    create parrent for server - common funcs there...

+: refactoring, introduce servers:
     +tutor
     +selfTester
todo: quizer

    all of them have the state

     common methods:
      
      changes of the state
      next2Numbers
      getOpr
      saveHistory
      saveState
    method prepareQuestion(curService) i.e. tutor, selfTester, quizer



+show in left area:
Tutor: sequential/random
operation: +/*...
step n of Ntotal

+ Tutor: state obj to introduce:
n1range
n2range
mode: sequential, random
currentStep
totalSteps

save Tutor setting in tutor.html send it to main
save tutor setting by every tutor step

repeatFrequency: - how often to repeat, selecting the worst answer 
by false and time. example: every 7th time select the worst from history
if there remain 0, not tried: every step select the worst.
if all answers are ok, stop. Ok means correct answer in 3 sec.

Tutor functionality:
getNextNumbers()
