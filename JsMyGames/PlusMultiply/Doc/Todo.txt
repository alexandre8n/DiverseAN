- todo: progress button for selfTester
  ? maybe this button should be hidden?

        average of correct,
        average time for correct
      the same for every range
      recommendation what to learn with Tutor first

  
+: from pause to continue (follow recom. should be Resume progress)
      in this case on onDlgFollowResume() should inititate the prevous progress.

+: style buttons: progress, ...
+: from follow recommandation in pause to continue?
+ todo: add progress button? by clicking it stop current run, show recommendation
  (Learing Step Is Finished! - > in case if not finished it should be:
  Learing Step Is Paused!)


+ td: more button in done dialog, show the grid with longest and false with
  details, op, res, time, true/false, score
  remark: one could just open history, but extend the history with:
    show wrong & longer than: 5 | sec (5 or 6 or ... should be defined)
    show wrong answers
    show correct answers
+ todo: restore help
    
+ show progress or learning step.

  + if tutor: progress: nn/NN
  + if progress is 100% dialog dlgFinishedTeachingId
          in it the recommandation should be taken from history

+bug in progress, it starts from 2
+ for more generality make next2Numbers return an object n1, n2, opr;

todo: clear history
todo: after finishing tutoring, dialog:
+ do you like to repeat all or the most difficult cases?
  this scenario: first - errors, second - the longest 10, that took more than 5 sec.
+ do you like to test your skills in a random way?
   ---> postponed: this should be done by quizer? ask the most difficult 20 and get estimate.

+todo: tricks for mult *11 -> a*11=aa, ab*11=a{a+b}b,19*11=209

-todo: recommended triks to use: tutor: 
nn*25 nn/4 r:0 00 r:1 25, r:2 50, r:3 75
96*25= 2400 97*25 = 2425 98*25=2450, 99*25=2475

-todo: recommended tricks
1x * 1y = (1x+y)*10 + x*y
 1x*1x = (1x +x)*10 + x*x 
 9x*9x = [y=10-x] -> (9x-y)*100 + y*y
 Example: 14*14 = (14+4)*10 +16 = 180+16=196
 19*19 = 280+81=361
 17*17 = (17+7=24)*10+49=289
 13*13 = 160+9=169
 97*97 = (100*100-2*3*100+9) = 100*100 - 2*300 + 9 = 
 ->(97-3)*100+9 = 9400 + 9 = 9409
92*92 -> (92-8)*100 + 8*8 = 8464

save Tutor setting in tutor.html send it to main
save tutor setting by every tutor step

repeatFrequency: - how often to repeat, selecting the worst answer 
by false and time. example: every 7th time select the worst from history
if there remain 0, not tried: every step select the worst.
if all answers are ok, stop. Ok means correct answer in 3 sec.
