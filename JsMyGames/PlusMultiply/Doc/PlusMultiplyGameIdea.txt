User should be able to learn addition and multiplication of 1 to 2 digit numbers
User should be able to select addition or multiplication
If selected addition there should be several levels:
	- first user should learn addition of one digit numbers
	- one digit plus 2 digit/or 2 digits + 1 digit
	- 2 digits plus 2 digits
	- 2 plus 3 digits
	- 3 plus 3 digits
after finishing addition, user should be able to learn multiplication
	- 1 digit per 1 digit
	- 1 digit per 2 digit
	- 2 digit per 2 digit

every session of learning should contain N exersizes (10 by default, but configurable)
if user answers wrong he should get the same exersize in the next session
user answers typing the result
if user answer takes longer than 1 sec, his result will be less points
the score per session is shown, the statistics of results, best results should be visible
it should be easy to follow the progress of the results (by score)
every level should have a complexity, the score should depend on the level of complexity and the time taken to get the result, if the answer given is wrong, the score is 0

after every exercise user should get the visible tip, how this calculation should be done easily.
examples:
19 + 4 = (4 is 3+1, (19+1) + 3 =20 + 3)= 23
65*65 = (easy quadrat calculation for numbers ending by 5: 6 * (6+1) = 42, answer : 4225)
37*33 = (both start from the same digit and second digits added =10, 
		so 3*(3+1)=12, 7*3=21 result: 1221)
		

98*33 = 3334 (98=100-2, so (100 - 2)*33 = 3300 - 66 = 3300 - 70 + 4 = 3230+4 = 3234)
or 98*33 = 98*11*3 = (980+98=1080-2=1078)*3 = 3000+210 +24 = 3234

user should be able to see all his calculations with score
example:
12*12 = 144 (+10 points, 2.5sec)
16*16 = 256 (+10 points, 2.6 sec)
19*19 = 369 (+7 points 4.5 sec)
